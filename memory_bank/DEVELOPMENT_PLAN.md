# DrillSargeant - Production Readiness Assessment Platform

## üéØ Project Overview

DrillSargeant is a comprehensive **interactive code review and improvement platform** designed to evaluate applications and guide users through specific issues with actionable fixes. Rather than just providing scores, the platform identifies problematic code sections, explains why they're issues, and provides step-by-step guidance to fix them. The platform helps development teams systematically improve their code quality, security, and production readiness through hands-on learning and guided improvement workflows.
